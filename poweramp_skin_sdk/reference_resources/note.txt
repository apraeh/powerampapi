Note on some drawable resources organization.

Some resource folders are in fact symbolic links to apprioriate directories as their contents is the same:

LINK                     -> REAL DIRECTORY
===========================================
drawable-sw600dp-hdpi-v11 -> drawable-xhdpi
drawable-sw600dp-mdpi-v11 -> drawable-hdpi
drawable-sw600dp-xhdpi-v11 -> drawable-xxhdpi

This is because current Poweramp themes use icons zoomed one DPI level up.
You can achieve the same results by either using symbolic links as specified above in your skin,
or by copying the same images each time before build to those folders.
