This pre-built project is here just to workaround Sony 4.2 ROMs issue with framework extended IDs (which that Sony ROMs fail to load).
It works by shifting those ids in skin by some offset by including extra APK as resource during skin build.

You don't need to change anything here or rebuild this project (prebuilt APK, which is used just in skin build process,
should be here already for you).
